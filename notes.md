1. Python was very straight forward

2. Apparent Go strings are utf-8 by default, what does that mean for Python?

3. Having to write if err != nil gets really annoying after a while. I can see why it does this, but theres gotta be a better way to do this. My files end up being 30% if err != nil control flows.
